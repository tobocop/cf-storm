	<h1>Welcome to storm!</h1>
	<p>
		Storm is totally awesome. The basic idea of storm is to have an ORM without all the hassle of configuration. Additionally, it's designed to be crud first, fancy later.
		What does that mean? Storm works out of the box for any simple crud function you can throw at it. When you want to get fancy and leverage objects, you can do that to. Storm lets you decide.
	</p>
	<h2>Setup</h2>
	<h3>Getting the files</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Take the storm folder.</li>
		<li>Copy it into your web_root (or other directory if you really want)</li>
		<li>Done!</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Instantiating</h3>
	<p>Storm is meant to run in the application scope, however you can put it wherever you want. To use it in the application scope:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset application.storm = createObject('component', 'storm.storm').init('[your data source]', '[custom object path]')>
	</xmp>
	<ul>
		<li>[your data source] = The coldfusion data source you wish to use storm with.</li>
		<li>[custom object path] (optional) = The dot path to the place where you will put custom objects. More on this later.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
	<h3>Getting Records</h3>
	<h4>Getting one record</h4>
		<p>To get a new record to save later or just to get a new blank record:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset newThing = application.storm.getOne("[TableName]")>
	</xmp>
	<ul>
		<li>[TableName] = The exact name of the table you're trying to work with</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Example:</h5>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne("users")>
	</xmp>
	 
	<h3>Creating a new record:</h3>
	<p>
		The important thing to note in this example is how you set properties on the thing you're trying to save. No getter or setter syntax. You can add those with a custom object if you want, which we'll talk about later.
		You'll notice if you dump out a struct you got from storm, it'll have a _TABLE_ key in it. You guessed it, this is how storm keeps track of where your struct came from and where to save it.
	</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne('users')>
	<cfset user.firstName = 'Awesome'>
	<cfset user.lastName = 'Panda'>
	<cfset application.storm.save(user)>
	</xmp>
	<h3>Update an existing record:</h3>
	<p>
		This is how to get a record by ID and update it:
	</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne('users', 1)>
	<cfset user.firstName = "New Awesome">
	<cfset application.storm.save(user)>
	</xmp>
	<p>See that 1? That's the primary key for the table. You might ask, how does storm know what my primary key is? By using cfdbinfo storm introspects your database. As long as your primary key is defined on the database table, storm knows what it is.
	<h2>Advanced Gets</h2>
	<p>Storm has a pretty robust system for getting things back. By using the getMany() method, you can have pretty strong control over what's returned. By default, these are returned as a query object. </p>
	<xmp>
	<!--- Returns all users --->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users')>

	<!--- Returns all users who are active --->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', where = 'active = 1')>

	<!--- Returns all users who are active with a firstname = awesome--->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', where = 'active = 1, firstName = awesome')>

	<!--- Returns all users who are active ordered by firstname asc--->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', where = 'active = 1', order = 'firstName ASC')>

	<!--- Returns all users who are active ordered by firstname asc and lastname desc--->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', where = 'active = 1', order = 'firstName ASC, lastName DESC')>

	<!--- Return only 1 user --->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', limit=1)>

	<!--- Return only userID --->
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', columns="users.userID")>
	</xmp>
	<p>
		Couple of things to note here:
		<ol>
			<li>The spacing is important in the where clause as it's used to parse values into cfqueryparams.</li>
			<li>The order clause just inserts it into the query, whatever you pass in there will be queried.</li>
			<li>When we returned only the userID, I used users.userID. For this query it doesn't matter, but for join queries storm pre-fixes columns with the full table name.</li>
		</ol>

	</p>
	<h3>Join Queries</h3>
	<p>Storm has support for join queries, but the syntax can be a little weird. Here is an example:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset users = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', join = ['roleTypes to users'])>
	</xmp>
	<p>Told you it was weird. The join argument takes an array of strings. Each element in the array is a {table} to {table2} statement. The first table will be used directly after the inner join. This means our example is equivelant to INNER JOIN roleTypes.</p>
	<p>Behind the scenes, storm figures out which table has the proper key to join on. To use storm joins, you have to name things properly. What this means is primary keys and foreign keys (in other tables) have the same name. In the above case, roleTypeID would be the primary key column name in roleTypes, and roleTypeID would be the foreign key column in the users table.</p>
	<p>Additionally, these can go multiple levels if you like. Such as:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset transactions = application.storm.getMany(table = 'users', join = ['transactions to users', 'transactionType to transactions'])>
	</xmp>

	<h2>Custom Objects</h2>
	<p>Hey! I thought storm was totally based on structures? WTF are objects doing in here! Well I'll tell you. Objects in storm are built to still function like structures with their syntax (no getters or setters), but sometimes an object just needs to be smarter. You can use storm without them super effectively, but sometimes you'll want to leverage storm objects because they're totally easy and awesome.</p>
	<p>Easy? But OO is hard! I don't like definig this either! You won't have to! Just one extra config when you initialize storm:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset application.storm = createObject('component', 'storm.storm').init('[your data source]', '[custom object path]')>
	</xmp>
	<p>See that [custom object path]? I told you we'd come back to it. That's a dot path to the directory where you want to put your storm objects. so let's say i initialized storm this way:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset application.storm = createObject('component', 'storm.storm').init('rockingDataSource', 'com.mysite.www.stormObjects')>
	</xmp>
	<p>Now, storm is now aware that you want to use objects, but it won't just turn everything into objects by default. Say you want your users to now come back as objects so you can create some neat custom validation or other object-y thing (or use storms helper functions for objects, they're totally sweet.). Just but a cfc with the same name as the table in your /com/mysite/www/stormObjects directory. That CFC by default should look like:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfcomponent extends="storm.stormTableObject">
	</cfcomponent>
	</xmp>
	<p>Note: if you didn't put storm in the web root, just change the extends statement.</p>
	<p>Now, before you go make your custom functions you already get some awesomeness:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You can still pass that object around like any other storm struct for saving and what not.</li>
		<li>Storm will look for objects in that directory, if it doesn't find one, it just returns you a good old struct.</li>
		<li>You get helper functions!</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Helper functions for objects</h3>
	<p>These helper functions help you. duh. Basically they're functions you can run on your object to get things that might be related to that object. Confused? good! here's an example to make it a lot easier to understand. For this i have a users.cfc setup in my object directory i defined above. Now I can do this:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne('users', 1)>
	<cfset user.getRoleTypes()>
	<cfdump var="#user.roleTypes#"><!--- Will output the role types associated to the user --->
	</xmp>
	<p>cool right? I know, still doesn't make sesne. Basically I never defined that getRoleTypes() function. What it boils down to is a getTableName() function. If storm finds keys that relate, it'll pull back everything that relates and stuff it into a corresponding key for that table name! A generic example would be: </p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset myObject = application.storm.getOne('[table name]', [id])>
	<cfset myObject.get[RelatedTableName]()>
	<cfdump var="#myObject.[RelatedTableName]#">
	</xmp>
	<h4>Specifying a return type</h4>
	<p>By default, storm will return this as a query (even if there's only 1). We can change it to a struct really easy though by passing in a returnType argument:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne('users', 1)>
	<cfset user.getRoleTypes(returnType="struct")>
	<cfdump var="#user.roleTypes#"><!--- Will output the role types associated to the user, as a struct or array of structs --->
	</xmp>
	<p>If you read that comment, it tells you that user.roleTypes will now either be a single struct (if only 1 was found), or an array of structs. Pretty cool right?</p>
	<p>This can also be used with a getMany:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset roleTypes = application.storm.getMany(table="roleTypes", returnType="struct")>
	</xmp>
	<p>Role types will now either be a single struct, or an array of structs for the user to use.</p>
	<p>As you might of guessed, if you have an object defined for that table, it'll return that instead of a struct. Say we put a roleTypes.cfc in our object directory. This example:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfset user = application.storm.getOne('users', 1)>
	<cfset user.getRoleTypes()>
	<cfdump var="#user.roleTypes#">
	</xmp>
	<p>That dump will now either return an array of objects, or a single object. Neat!</p>
	<h3>Beyond helper functions</h3>
	<p>Ok, now we have a custom object. We already get all the awesomeness of helper objects, but what else can we do? Say by default, every time I get a user, i want to get their role types. Simple! just add an init function:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfcomponent extends="storm.stormTableObject">
		<cffunction name="init">
			<cfset this.getRoleTypes()>
		</cffunction>
	</cfcomponent>
	</xmp>
	<p>Now, every time you call to get a user object, their associated role type will be returned!</p>
	<p>What about that oh so common, user.getName() function that concats their firstname and lastname for you? Easy:</p>
	<xmp>
	<cfcomponent extends="storm.stormTableObject">
		<cffunction name="init">
			<cfset this.getRoleTypes()>
		</cffunction>
		<cffunction name="getName">
			<cfreturn this.firstName & ' ' & this.lastName>
		</cffunction>
	</cfcomponent>
	</xmp>
	<p>Couldn't be easier.</p>
	<h2>Drawbacks</h2>
	<p>Storm is totally awesome. But this is version 1.0. Here's what I want to add in the future:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The option to save nested objects (save the user, their roleType is saved.)</li>
		<li>Caching.</li>
		<li>Support for MySQL.</li>
	</ol>
